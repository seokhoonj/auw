\title{Overlap claim matrices}
\usage{
overlap_matrix(clm, clm_1st, col)
}
\arguments{
\item{clm}{A matrix. Original claim matrix.}

\item{clm_1st}{A matrix of the same dimension as \code{clm}. For each column,
only the first claim is \code{1}, and the rest are \code{0}.}

\item{col}{Logical or numeric vector of length equal to \code{ncol(clm)}.
If \code{1}, the column is treated as one-time payment; if \code{0}, as continuous.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimension as \code{clm}, with one-time payment
columns replaced by \code{clm_1st}.
}
\description{
Combine two claim matrices (\code{clm} and \code{clm_1st}) according to a binary
indicator for one-time versus continuous payment.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item If a claim column corresponds to a one-time payment, values from
\code{clm_1st} replace those in \code{clm}.
\item If a claim column corresponds to a continuous payment, values remain
unchanged in \code{clm}.
}
